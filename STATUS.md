## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions

- **Category IDs**: Changed from UUID to human-readable strings (TRAUMA, AIRWAY) for easier debugging and API usage
- **Database**: SQLite for development, easy migration to PostgreSQL for production
- **Frontend**: Material-UI chosen for comprehensive component library and professional appearance
- **Dark Mode**: Default to reduce eye strain during night shifts

### Lessons Learned

- SQLAlchemy relationships need careful attention when mixing UUID and String primary keys
- Database rebuilds are cleaner than complex migrations during active development
- Eager loading (`joinedload`) essential for relationship data
- CSV handling needs proper escaping and validation
